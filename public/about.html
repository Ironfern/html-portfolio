<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm a 52-year-old ecommerce manager with a passion for continuous learning and a love for the outdoors. My professional journey has given me a deep understanding of the digital marketplace, and I'm currently expanding my skillset by diving into the exciting world of full-stack web development. This new venture isn't just a hobby; it's about empowering myself with the technical knowledge to innovate and drive even greater success in my ecommerce role.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in code or strategizing about online sales, you'll likely find me out on the trails on my mountain bike. There's nothing quite like the thrill of navigating challenging terrain and enjoying the fresh air. It's a perfect way to clear my head and re-energize, much like the satisfaction I get from solving a complex coding problem or optimizing an ecommerce platform.</p>

<p>I believe in the power of embracing new challenges, whether it's mastering a new programming language or conquering a steep mountain trail. This website is a reflection of my journey, showcasing my evolving skills in web development and offering a glimpse into my professional and personal pursuits. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
